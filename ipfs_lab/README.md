Design Patterns IPFS lab.

Notes:

->Make sure ipfs is running before executing.
->Kindly make sure to have CORS plugin installed on your browser(chrome).
->Idealy one should be able to upload the image and see it on the screen once the ipfs storage is complete.
-> Could'nt connect with ipfs due to local machine problem. so I was not able to test.
